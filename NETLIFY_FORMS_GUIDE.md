# Netlify Forms Integration - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

Netlify Forms has been successfully integrated into the ServAI landing page demo request form.

## üéØ What Was Changed

### 1. Form HTML Attributes
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/App.js`

Added Netlify-specific attributes:
```jsx
<form 
  className="demo-form" 
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  name="demo-request"
  method="POST"
  data-netlify="true"
  data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"
>
```

### 2. Hidden Fields
Added required fields for Netlify:
- `form-name`: Identifies the form to Netlify
- `bot-field`: Honeypot for spam protection (hidden from users)

### 3. Form Submission Handler
Updated `handleSubmit` function to send data to Netlify:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    'form-name': 'demo-request',
    'name': formData.name,
    'email': formData.email,
    'phone': formData.phone,
    'restaurant-name': formData.restaurantName,
    'location': formData.location
  }).toString()
});
```

### 4. Static Form Detection
**File:** `/app/frontend/public/demo-request.html`

Created static HTML file for Netlify to detect the form at build time.

## üìä Form Fields

The form collects the following data:
1. **Name** - Customer's full name
2. **Email** - Contact email address
3. **Phone** - Phone number
4. **Restaurant Name / Website** - Business name or URL
5. **Location** - Country or city location

## üöÄ How It Works

### On User Submission:
1. User fills out the form
2. Clicks "Request Demo"
3. Data sent to Netlify via POST request
4. Netlify processes and stores the submission
5. Success message displayed
6. Form resets after 5 seconds

### Behind The Scenes:
1. Netlify detects form during build (via static HTML file)
2. Creates backend endpoint automatically
3. Stores submissions in Netlify dashboard
4. Can send email notifications
5. Prevents spam with honeypot field
