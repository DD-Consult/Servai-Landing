# Netlify Node Version Error - FIXED

## Error Message
```
Failed during stage 'Install dependencies': dependency_installation script returned non-zero exit code: 1
error react-router-dom@7.9.4: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=20.0.0". Got "18.20.8"
```

## Root Cause
React Router DOM version 7.x requires Node.js 20 or higher, but Netlify was using Node 18.

## âœ… Solution Applied

The following files have been updated to use Node 20:

### 1. `/netlify.toml` (Root)
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

### 2. `/frontend/netlify.toml`
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

### 3. `/frontend/.nvmrc`
```
20
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy Again

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
1. Commit these changes:
```bash
git add netlify.toml frontend/netlify.toml frontend/.nvmrc
git commit -m "Fix: Update Node version to 20 for react-router-dom compatibility"
git push
```

2. Netlify will automatically redeploy with Node 20

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Clear cache and deploy site"
4. Build will now use Node 20

## âœ… Verification

After deployment succeeds, you should see in build logs:
```
Node version: v20.x.x
```

And the build will complete successfully without the engine compatibility error.

## ðŸ“‹ What Changed

- **Before:** Node 18 (incompatible with react-router-dom 7.x)
- **After:** Node 20 (compatible with all dependencies)

## ðŸŽ‰ Next Steps

1. Push the changes to your repository
2. Wait for Netlify to redeploy (2-3 minutes)
3. Your site will be live!

No other changes needed - your code is ready to deploy.
